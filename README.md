## About
**Speedo Bot** is my first ever Discord bot, and I'm finally starting to become satisfied with it, almost no errors, except for the very new additions. The community is even starting to grow. Soon I'll be collaborating with other members, which is very exciting.

**Speedo Bot** will eventually contain an interactive game just like other bots, like Dank Memer, but in my own custom version. 

You should engage with my community to improve and ask about Speedo Bot and have fun!
## Usage
To get a list of all **Speedo Bot** commands, type `speedo help` in your dedicated bot commands channel (if any). Please note you need to give **Speedo Bot** the permissions
to DM you in order to get the help message.

To get information about a specific command, you need to use `speedo help <command>`, and you will be DMed the information about that command.

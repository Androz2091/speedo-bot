<h2>Pledge</h2>
This software is free. By "free", we mean no cost for any feature, freedom, and ability to use the program easily. We don't want contributors to create a sexual environment,
bully or otherwise harass other contributors based on personal qualities, or anything else that could affect other contributors. It could possibly come to the point that 
contributors would _leave_ because of bad behavior in the project. To prevent this, we actively look at the project, work on it, moderate it, and hire more moderators.
